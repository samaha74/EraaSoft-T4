overloading is when you mack two func. with diff arguments.
example: in the the last sess. when we talked abput Constructors in a class it was said that i can make Constructors with no args and give the vars default vals AND make another Constructors with each var taken as an argument

it can be used be used in multiple other senarios and i have actually used it in ither projects as it is a core concept of programming in General
