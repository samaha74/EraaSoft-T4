overloading is when you make two func. with diff arguments.
example: in the last sess. when we talked about Constructors in a class it was said that I can make Constructors with no args and give the vars default vals AND make another Constructors with each var taken as an argument

it can be used in multiple other scenarios and I have actually used it in other projects as it is a core concept of programming in general
